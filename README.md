# Features of AI Document Assistant
The AI Document Assistant is a Streamlit-based application designed to simplify interactions with Excel documents using AI. Below are the key features of the application:

1. User-Friendly Interface
The app provides a clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit.
Users can interact with the AI directly via a chat interface.


2. Excel File Upload
Users can upload Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) directly through the sidebar.
The app reads the uploaded file and converts its content into a readable format for AI interaction.
The uploaded file's content is displayed as a scrollable, styled DataFrame for easy review.


3. AI-Powered Chat Assistance
Powered by the Groq API, the app can answer user queries about the uploaded Excel file.
Example use cases:
Summarize data in the Excel file.
Provide insights or statistical analysis based on the content.
Answer specific questions, such as finding values, trends, or anomalies.
Handle general inquiries or greet users with a friendly tone.


4. Session State Management
Session persistence ensures that the chat history and uploaded Excel file content are maintained during the session.
Users can have an uninterrupted conversation with the AI while referring to previously uploaded files.


5. Dynamic Prompt Construction
If an Excel file is uploaded, the AI combines the file's content with the user's query to provide contextually relevant responses.
If no file is uploaded, the AI defaults to handling general queries.


6. Natural Language Understanding
Supports natural conversation:
Recognizes greetings and goodbyes, responding appropriately.
Handles specific document-related queries intelligently.


7. Interactive Chat System
Chat history is displayed in a threaded format:

8. Error Handling

An invalid or unsupported file is uploaded.
The AI model encounters an error during query processing.
